# Angular2 + ES6 Starter Pack

  What up, I couldn't find the an Angular2 starter pack with the tech stack I wanted, so I made one.
  It's super bare bones, don't get your hopes up.

  The stack includes:
   * Angular2
   * ES6
   * Webpack (for preprocessing and bundling)
   * NPM scripts (for all commands)
   * Jasmine/Karma (for testing)

### Quick start
 ```bash
# Download dependencies
npm install

# Start the server on port 9000
# This will run the build and serve commands
npm start

# To just run the webpack build
npm run build

# To just run the server
npm run serve
```

### Resources

  Some of this is from scratch, other parts I stole from other repositories.
  So to give credit to where it's due, here are some of the things I used.
   * [Jasmine/Karma config](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter)

# Game Plan
  If you want to add to this, feel free. I want to aim for general purpose without
  being as bulky as a lot of other starter packs. Let's keep this minimalistic.

  Some more things I plan to add:
   * Express
   * Sequelize
